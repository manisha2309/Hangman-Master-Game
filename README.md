Title---->Hangman-Master-Game <br>
This is a team project on a guessing game where one player guess the letters by suggesting some where the letter is selected by the system.
The word is represented by a row of dashes, with each dash representing a letter in the word. The guessing player suggests letters one at a time, and if the letter is in the word, the system reveals its correct positions. If the letter is not in the word, the guessing player receives a strike. The game continues until the guessing player correctly guesses the word or accumulates too many strikes, resulting in a loss. It's a fun and challenging game that tests vocabulary and deductive skills.

Instructions: <br>

- Setup: One player ( i.e.the "system") decides a word and keeps it secret. They draw a series of dashes, each representing a letter in the word.<br>

- Guessing: The other player (the "guesser") starts guessing letters. If the guessed letter is in the word, the word chooser writes it in all the correct positions. If the guessed letter is not in the word, the word chooser adds a body part to the hangman scaffold (e.g., head, body, arms, legs).<br>

- Objective: The guesser's objective is to guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn. If they can guess all the letters in the word before the hangman is complete, they win. If the hangman is fully drawn before they guess the word, they lose.<br>

- Rules: Usually, the word chooser provides a category or a hint to give the guesser an idea of what the word might be.<br>
The guesser typically has a limited number of incorrect guesses before the hangman is fully drawn (e.g., 6 incorrect guesses).


Version1:<br>
In Version 1 of our game, we encountered the following problems:-
The player might find the game very basic, as it's not very interactive and visually appealing, which could be improved using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter. By adding the GUI version, it enhances the Hangman game by providing a more user-friendly interface, better feedback mechanisms, and improved interaction with the game. This version of the game lacks variety in word selection, making it predictable and reducing replay value over time. Furthermore, the player does not get instant feedback through printed messages in the console after every guess, which also makes it less user-friendly.
